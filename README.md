Using a dataset containing information on Snapchat advertisements in the US in 2020, I focus on the candidates Joe Biden and Donald Trump and answer the following questions:
-   Is there a relationship between political ad expenditure and impressions?
-   Which candidate's advertisements received more impressions?
-   How much was spent on these advertisements and which candidate spent more on average?
-   Which states were targeted by these advertisements, and which states did each candidate target more?
